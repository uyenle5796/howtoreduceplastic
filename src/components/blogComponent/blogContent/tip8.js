          Due to having high durability that helps keep food fresh for longer, prevents contamination as well as being very easy & cheap to produce,
          plastic has been the go-to choice for producers to package their products in.
          Almost any shops or supermarkets you go to, you will always find products packaged in plastic: meat, vegetables, sweets, fizzy drinks, cleaning products, etc.
          <br/>
          Therefore, one of the best ways to reduce plastic waste and pollution is to <b>stop producing them</b>. Although efforts have been made to reduce plastic waste such as adding a small charge to plastic bags, paper cups, etc.
          in the end, they are already produced and will probably end up as waste. Therefore it is best to ditch them completely.
          <br/><br/>

          You can help solve this problem by <b>emailing businesses and encourage them to rethink their pointless packaging</b>.
          Almost every company will have an email on their website that you can reach out to for any enquiries. Better yet, Greenpeace has created a page where you can easily tell your supermarket of choice about this problem: <a href="https://act.greenpeace.org/page/29634/action/1">Tell your supermarket CEOs to ditch plastic</a>.
          <br/><br/>
          Giving direct feedback to busineses will create much greater impact and hence better encourage them to make a change!
