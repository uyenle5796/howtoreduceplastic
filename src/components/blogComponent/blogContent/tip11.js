          Just because plastic waste and pollution don't seem apparent in your
          daily life, doesn't mean that they're not happening. So skip that
          ignorance and open your eyes to what's happening around you. Keeping
          yourself informed about latest news on plastic as well as the
          environment in general will give yourself much better understanding
          and awareness on how plastic is affecting the world we live in today.
          You don't have to go far, the following sites have a wealth of
          information on latest news on plastic:
          <br />
          <br />
          {this.state.webPagesList.map(item => {
            return (
              <ul key={item.id}>
                <li>
                  <a href={item.linkTo}>{item.title}</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            );
          })}
          <li>
            Finally, your smartphone is another a great source of information -
            simply search for "plastic pollution" on your phone's news app. The
            world really is at your fingertips!
