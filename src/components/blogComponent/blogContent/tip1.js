          Single use plastics are plastics that are used only once and thrown
          away right after, such as coffee cups, plastic food containers,
          plastic cutlery, plastic bags and much much more. Together with our
          "throw away" culture, every day millions of plastics are consumed, but
          not enough effort has been made to recycle or reuse them, making
          single use plastic a major contributor to pollution and damaging
          wildlife and the environment.
          <br />
          <br />
          Therefore, the first and most important step to your reducing plastic
          journey is learning to <b>say no to all single-use plastics</b>. You
          can get started by following these tips:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span role="img" aria-label="Cup">
                ü•§
              </span>
              <b>Always have a reusable cup, shopping bag and cutlery</b> with
              you so you can use them when needed, plus you get 25p off too!
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span role="img" aria-label="No">
                üôÖ
              </span>
              ‚Äç<b>Refuse plastics when offered</b>.
              <br />
              This happens a lot when buying takeway as the staff tend to give
              you additional cutlery and tissues. This also happens during
              checkout at stores when the staff packs your vegetables in plastic
              bags. Next time you encouter these situations, kindly return them
              and say "No, thank you. I'm trying to cut down plastic waste."
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <span role="img" aria-label="Recycle">
                ‚ôªÔ∏è
              </span>
              ‚Äç<b>Be a conscious consumer</b>
              <br />
              Check for recycling label on every item before you buy it. Avoid
              buying items that have "Not Currently Recylable" labels and choose
              those that say "Widely Recycled" instead.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          It may be daunting when you first start doing them, but trust me, keep
          them in your mind and one day you'll be doing them without even
          knowing it!
